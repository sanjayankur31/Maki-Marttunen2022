## Setup

Please use the `requirements.txt` file to set up a new Python virtual environment for use.
This, for Python version 3, should look something like this:

```
python3 -m venv /path/to/a/venv/folder
source /path/to/a/venv/folder/bin/activate
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Cells

Standardised NeuroML implementations of various cell models are kept in this directory.

## Experiments

The `experiments` folder contains individual experiments in different folders with their specific documentations.
